## About this Project

The idea of the App is:

_"Be a dashboard for sending notifications for specific users (or all users) from some datasource"._

## Some Observations about this App

- This app uses Typescript, so, if you never used it before with React, this project could be a very good kickstart for you (I'm still learning, ok?  ðŸ˜‰).

- This project uses the React hooks all around (useCallback, useState, useEffect...), so, if you want to see these features in action, take a look on the project!

- Speaking about hooks, this project shares a specific functionality with the [expo-notifications-app](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-app), that is the functionality to fetch data using HTTP protocol. Both projects use exactly the same implementation, take a look: [expo-useFetch](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-app/blob/master/src/hooks/useFetch.ts) and [web-useFetch](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-dashboard/blob/master/src/hooks/useFetch.ts).
This is a perfect example of how we can share code using hooks, we can write the functionality once and reuse them on the web, mobile and wherever you can use React!

- This Dashboard is connected to the [expo-notifications-api](https://github.com/steniowagner/expo-notifications-api), but you can easily change to your own server and reuse all the functionality on this Dashboard and then be able to get the users and send notifications to your own server!
